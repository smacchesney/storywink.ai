# Task ID: 2
# Title: Optimize UI/UX Across Core Application Pages
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the user interface and experience of all core application pages to improve usability, accessibility, and visual consistency.
# Details:
This task involves a comprehensive review and optimization of the UI/UX for all core application pages. The developer should:

1. Conduct an audit of all core pages to identify inconsistencies in design elements, navigation patterns, and interaction models
2. Implement a consistent color scheme and typography system according to our brand guidelines
3. Optimize page layouts for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using responsive design principles
4. Reduce page load times by optimizing assets and implementing lazy loading where appropriate
5. Improve form designs with clear validation messages and intuitive input fields
6. Enhance navigation with breadcrumbs and clear hierarchical structure
7. Add appropriate micro-interactions and transitions to improve user feedback
8. Implement accessibility improvements including proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA compliance)
9. Standardize button styles, input fields, and other UI components across all pages
10. Ensure consistent spacing and alignment using a defined grid system

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the technical implementation and user experience improvements:

1. Cross-browser testing: Verify optimizations work correctly in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
2. Responsive testing: Validate layouts at standard breakpoints (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px)
3. Accessibility testing: Run automated tests with tools like Axe or Lighthouse to verify WCAG AA compliance
4. Performance testing: Measure and compare page load times before and after optimization using Lighthouse or WebPageTest
5. User testing: Conduct moderated sessions with 5-7 users to gather qualitative feedback on the improved interfaces
6. Visual regression testing: Use tools like Percy or Applitools to ensure no unintended visual changes
7. Usability heuristic evaluation: Assess against Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics
8. A/B testing: For critical pages, implement A/B tests to measure performance improvements quantitatively
9. Device testing: Verify optimizations on actual iOS and Android devices, not just emulators
10. Validate consistent implementation of design system components across all pages
