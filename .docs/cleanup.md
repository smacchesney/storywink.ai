Okay, let's break down potential areas for cleanup and identify possibly redundant code or files based on the iterations you've described.

**Key Areas of Change & Potential Redundancies:**

1.  **Prisma Schema & Generated Types vs. Custom Types:**
    *   **`src/types/index.ts`**:
        *   The interfaces `User`, `Book`, `Page`, `Asset` are likely **redundant**. You should directly use the types generated by Prisma from `@prisma/client` (e.g., `import { Book, Page, Asset, User } from '@prisma/client';`). This ensures your types are always in sync with your schema.
        *   The enums `BookStatus` and `PageType` defined here are also redundant. Use `import { BookStatus, PageType } from '@prisma/client';` from `$Enums`.
        *   Custom combined types like `BookWithStoryboardPages` and `StoryboardPage` are good and should be kept as they define specific shapes needed by your components.
    *   **Action**: Refactor your codebase to import model types and enums directly from `@prisma/client` and `$Enums` respectively. Remove the redundant definitions from `src/types/index.ts`.

2.  **API Endpoints:**
    *   **`src/app/api/book-content/route.ts`**:
        *   This endpoint seems to fetch book pages. The `GET` handler in `src/app/api/book/[bookId]/route.ts` also fetches the book with its pages.
        *   **Potential Redundancy**: If `/api/book/[bookId]/route.ts` provides all necessary page data for the review page and any other consumers, then `/api/book-content/route.ts` might be redundant.
        *   **Check**: Verify if `review/page.tsx` or any other component *only* needs the pages array without the full book details. If `/api/book/[bookId]/route.ts` is always called anyway, then `book-content` is likely unused.
    *   **Action**: If confirmed redundant, delete `src/app/api/book-content/route.ts` and update any remaining consumers to use `/api/book/[bookId]/route.ts`.

3.  **Prisma Client Instantiation:**
    *   You have `src/lib/db.ts` and `src/lib/prisma.ts`. Both seem to instantiate `PrismaClient`.
    *   **Redundancy**: You only need one canonical way to instantiate and export your Prisma client.
    *   **Check**: Determine which one is consistently imported and used throughout the application (server-side code, API routes, server actions). The `db.ts` pattern (`globalThis.__prisma`) is a common and good practice for Next.js to avoid creating too many connections in development.
    *   **Action**: Consolidate to one (likely `src/lib/db.ts`). Delete the other and update all imports.

4.  **Page Indexing and Title Page Logic:**
    *   **`Page.pageNumber` vs. `Page.index`**:
        *   The schema now has `Page.index` (default 0). The `reorder` API updates this `index`.
        *   `Page.pageNumber` is often set as `index + 1` for display.
        *   **Review**: Ensure that `pageNumber` is consistently treated as a display value derived from `index` and not as a separate source of truth for ordering, especially during page creation and updates. If `index` is the sole authority for order, `pageNumber` might only be needed at the presentation layer.
        *   In `src/app/api/book/create/route.ts`, both `pageNumber: index + 1` and `index: index` are set. This is correct for initialization.
        *   In `src/queues/workers/story-generation.worker.ts` and `illustration-generation.worker.ts`, `pageNumber` is used from the job data. The API routes creating these jobs correctly set these page numbers based on the filtered/sorted list (e.g., `storyIndex + 1`). This seems consistent.
    *   **`Page.isTitlePage` vs. `Book.coverAssetId`**:
        *   `Book.coverAssetId` now links an `Asset` to be the cover.
        *   `Page.isTitlePage` is set to `true` for the first page created in `/api/book/create/route.ts`.
        *   In `src/app/create/[bookId]/edit/page.tsx`, `orderedPagesForDisplay` prioritizes `coverAssetId` to find the cover page, falling back to `isTitlePage`.
        *   In `src/app/create/review/page.tsx`, `isTitlePageSelected` checks `currentIndex === 0`.
        *   **Potential Simplification**: If `Book.coverAssetId` becomes the *sole* determinant of the cover image, and the page associated with this asset is always treated as the title page (and perhaps always has `index: 0`), then the `Page.isTitlePage` boolean might become less critical or redundant. However, it can be a useful quick flag.
        *   **Action**: Review all uses of `isTitlePage`. If `Book.coverAssetId` and `Page.index === 0` (for the page linked to `coverAssetId`) consistently define the cover, you might simplify logic relying on `isTitlePage`. For now, it seems to act as a reasonable default/fallback.

5.  **Context (`src/context/BookCreationContext.tsx`)**:
    *   The editor (`edit/page.tsx`) and review page (`review/page.tsx`) now fetch data primarily using `bookId` from the URL.
    *   **Question**: What critical state is `BookCreationContext` still managing and passing between `/create/*` routes?
        *   Initial asset upload on `/create/page.tsx` results in `assetIds`. These are passed to `/api/book/create`. The API returns a `bookId`. The router then navigates to `/create/[bookId]/edit`.
        *   The context *could* be used to pass the initially selected `assetIds` or basic book settings from `/create` to `/edit` before the first full book fetch in `/edit`, but this seems less critical now that `/edit` fetches everything.
    *   **Potential Redundancy**: If the context is primarily holding data that's immediately re-fetched or managed by URL params + local component state, its role might be significantly reduced or it could be removed.
    *   **Action**: Evaluate if `BookCreationContext` is still essential. If its state is largely duplicated by API-fetched data in the editor/review pages, consider simplifying or removing it to avoid state synchronization issues.

6.  **UI Components (`src/components/ui/`)**:
    *   Files like `alert-dialog.tsx`, `button.tsx`, `card.tsx`, `dialog.tsx`, `drawer.tsx`, `dropdown-menu.tsx`, `input.tsx`, `label.tsx`, `progress.tsx`, `radio-group.tsx`, `select.tsx`, `sheet.tsx`, `skeleton.tsx`, `sonner.tsx`, `switch.tsx`, `tabs.tsx`, `textarea.tsx`, `tooltip.tsx` are likely from shadcn/ui or a similar library. They are generally not redundant unless you've stopped using a particular component entirely.
    *   **Custom UI Components**:
        *   `rough-border.tsx`, `rough-button.tsx`, `rough-input-wrapper.tsx`, `rough-underline.tsx`: These are custom "rough" style components. If this aesthetic is no longer a core part of the design or is used sparingly, you might consider if they are all still needed or if the effect can be achieved more simply. This is more of a design/UX cleanup.
    *   **Action**: Manually review the usage of each UI component. If a component (especially custom ones) is no longer used, it can be removed.

7.  **Generated Prisma Client Files (`src/generated/prisma/client/`)**:
    *   Files like `index.js`, `index-browser.js`, `edge.js`, `wasm.js`, `library.js`, `react-native.js`, and their `.d.ts` counterparts are **auto-generated by Prisma**. Do not manually delete or modify these unless you understand the implications for different runtime environments.
    *   The `package.json` inside `src/generated/prisma/client` is also auto-generated.
    *   `schema.prisma` inside this directory is a copy of your main schema and is also managed by Prisma.

8.  **Worker-related `package.json` files**:
    *   `src/lib/package.json` and `src/queues/workers/package.json` (both `{"type": "commonjs"}`): These are likely still necessary if your workers are compiled to CommonJS and need to correctly interpret modules within `src/lib` or their own directory.
    *   **Action**: Verify if your worker build process (`tsconfig.worker.json` and `npm run build:worker`) still relies on these for correct module resolution. If `tsconfig.worker.json` now correctly outputs CommonJS and resolves paths without these, they *might* be redundant, but they are small and generally harmless.

9.  **CSS Files**:
    *   `src/app/globals.css`: This is the standard Next.js global CSS file.
    *   `src/styles/globals.css`: This seems like a duplicate or an old location. Next.js App Router typically uses `src/app/globals.css`.
    *   **Action**: Consolidate global styles into `src/app/globals.css` and remove `src/styles/globals.css` if it's empty or redundant. Update any import paths if necessary.

10. **`next.config.ts` vs `next.config.mjs`**:
    *   You have both. Next.js will typically use `next.config.mjs` if present.
    *   **Action**: Ensure all configurations are in `next.config.mjs` and delete `next.config.ts` if it's a duplicate or outdated.

**Summary of Recommended Actions & Checks:**

*   **Definite Cleanup**:
    *   Refactor to use Prisma-generated types instead of custom ones in `src/types/index.ts`.
    *   If `/api/book-content/route.ts` is unused, delete it.
    *   Consolidate Prisma client instantiation to `src/lib/db.ts` and remove `src/lib/prisma.ts`.
    *   Consolidate global CSS into `src/app/globals.css` and remove `src/styles/globals.css`.
    *   Consolidate Next.js config into `next.config.mjs` and remove `next.config.ts`.

*   **Investigate for Potential Simplification/Removal**:
    *   `BookCreationContext`: Evaluate its current necessity.
    *   `Page.isTitlePage`: Check if `Book.coverAssetId` and `Page.index === 0` are sufficient.
    *   Custom `rough-*` UI components: Review their usage and necessity.

*   **Do Not Touch (Unless you're sure)**:
    *   Files within `src/generated/prisma/client/`.
    *   `package.json` files in `src/lib` and `src/queues/workers` (verify necessity first).

Always make sure to test thoroughly after any cleanup! Good luck!
